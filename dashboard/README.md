# SRI Testing Dashboard



## .env configuration

The Dashboard relies on some site specific parameters - encoded in a **.env** environmental variable configuration file -to work properly.

Note that the **.env** file is **.gitignored** in the repo. A template file, [dot_env_template](dot_env_template) is provided. A copy of this file should be made into a file called **.env** and customized to site requirements (see below).

### Setting up API connection

In the `.env` file in `dashboard/`, set `API_HOST` to the domain name of the API, and `API_PORT` to the port of the API, if applicable.

The default protocol is `http://`.
