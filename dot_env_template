# There is an internal "mock" registry inside the API container
# that is accessed for testing purposes, instead of the real
# external Translator SmartAPI Registry. This mock registry contains
# one ARA, 'arax', and two KPs, 'sri-reference-kg' and 'molepro'.
# Uncomment the following to set the MOCK_TRANSLATOR_REGISTRY to the '1' to use it.
# MOCK_TRANSLATOR_REGISTRY=1
